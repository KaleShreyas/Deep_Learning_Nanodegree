# Predicting Bike-Sharing Data (Your First Neural Network)
In this project, you'll get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset which comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

# Dog-Breed Classifier
In this project, you will learn how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human face, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.

# TV Script Generation
In this project, you'll generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new, "fake" TV script.
