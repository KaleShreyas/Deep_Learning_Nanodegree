# Predicting Bike-Sharing Data (First Neural Network)
In this project, we get to build a neural network from scratch to carry out a prediction problem on a real dataset which comes from the [UCI Machine Learning Database](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bike+Sharing+Dataset).

# Dog-Breed Classifier
In this project, we will learn how to build a pipeline to process real-world, user-supplied images. Given an image of a dog, your algorithm will identify an estimate of the canineâ€™s breed. If supplied an image of a human face, the code will identify the resembling dog breed.
Dataset is already included in the repository.

# TV Script Generation
In this project, we'll generate your own Seinfeld TV scripts using RNNs. You'll be using a Seinfeld dataset of scripts from 9 seasons. The Neural Network you'll build will generate a new, "fake" TV script.
Dataset is already included in the repository.

# Face genration using GAN's
In this project, we'll use generative adversarial networks to generate new images of faces. Dataset can be obtained from : http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/CelebA.html
The dataset is more complex than the number datasets (like MNIST or SVHN) so GPU usage is advised.

# Deploying a Sentiment Analysis Model
In this project you will construct a recurrent neural network for the purpose of determining the sentiment of a movie review using the IMDB data set. You will create this model using Amazon's SageMaker service. In addition, you will deploy your model and construct a simple web app which will interact with the deployed model.
